# Project Manager
A simple application to help manage projects. 
## Setup
You will need Docker for an easy setup. You can download Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

1. Start Docker

2. Open a terminal

3. Execute the following command to start the docker containers:
```shell
docker compose up
```
This step might take a couple of minutes as docker needs to create the client, server and database containers.

You should now be able to access the application in a browser with the following link : ```http://localhost:4200/```

+ **Note**: It is recommended to use Docker but you can also run it locally if you have everything setup like in the docker compose.
